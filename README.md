Austin Coding Academy Chapter 1 class assignment

I enjoyed this first challenge. It was good to settle the nerves. I am relaxed in class now. The hardest part of this assignment was searching the internet to find a simple solution to display a picture. This assignment allowed me to find a workflow to complete assignments. I am getting more comfortable with the process of complteing of chap 1 and 2. I am wondering how much more there is to learn for the rest of the class. I would like more than one option of assignment for each chapter. I am sure there must be alot more knowledge to learn. It is nice to learn a new way to develop websites. It makes me feel old to ftp a website to the server. Time to update my work flow and web development process.
